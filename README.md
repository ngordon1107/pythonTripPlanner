# Trip Planner
> This app helps you keep track of all of your upcoming trips! Keeping your trip planning in one place.

The Trip Planner allows you to see a birdseye or detailed view of all of your trips, add your Trips to a locally stored database, edit, and delete them. The following features are currently supported:
* Trip title
* Arrival and departure dates
* Destination details (city, country/region)
* Arrival/Departure flight information for direct flights only (date, time, confirmation numbers)
* Accommodations information (name, address, phone number, check in and out, cost, notes)

Soon to be supported:
* Flight information (multiple legs)

## Installation

No installation required.

Just run the trip_planner.py file in your CLI using the following command:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Usage example

* Create your dream trip list to plan over the next few years!
* Organize upcoming trip dates to ensure nothing overlaps :)
* Keep your flight and accommodations information all in one place

That's all for now! Stay tuned for more features
